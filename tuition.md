A running tally of resources consumed while educating other miners on the Golden Rule will be used to calculate the tuition owed by the miner or their corporation.  The cirriculum is wholly up to the WBA agent enforcing the Golden Rule.

### Tuition Cost
Total Cost of Education = Number of days * ISK value of Ships used * 1.2

### Example
Agents of the WBA organized 5 Dildos of Consequence for two days and conducted a round of ganks with 5 Talos for one day before the pilot submitted signaling the end of their re-education.

4,500,000,000 = 3 * ((5 * 30,000,000) + (5 * 220,000,000)) * 1.2
