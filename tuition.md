title: Tuition
---

A running tally of resources consumed while educating other miners on the Golden Rule will be used to calculate the tuition owed by the miner or their corporation.  The cirriculum is wholly up to the <abbr title="Workingmen's Benevolent Association">WBA</abbr> agent enforcing the Golden Rule.

### Tuition Cost
Total Cost of Education = ISK value of Ships used * (1.5 + School Days / 10)

### Example
Agents of the <abbr title="Workingmen's Benevolent Association">WBA</abbr> organized 5 Dildos of Consequence and conducted a round of ganks with 5 Talos before the pilot submitted signaling the end of their re-education.  There were three school days.

2,250,000,000 ISK = (5 * 30,000,000 ISK + 5 * 220,000,000 ISK) * (1.5 + 3/10)
