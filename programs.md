Below are a list of best practices for enforcing the Golden Rule once violated by a mining leader sorted by least to most severe.

### [Miner Bumping](http://www.minerbumping.com/)
The <abbr title="Workingmen's Benevolent Association">WBA</abbr> endorses Thoraxes flying under the name, ["Dildo of Consequences"](https://www.eveworkbench.com/fitting/thorax/55bd1d2a-e72f-4520-64a1-08dc01d3f75c).  They do not come lubed.

### Counter Mining
A fleet consisting of one Porpoise or Orca and at least two mining barges or exhumers fitted with [Tier 2 Type C Mining Crystals](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Mining_crystals#Type_C).

### [Catalyst Ganks](https://www.eveworkbench.com/fitting/catalyst/64f077fa-e15d-477f-6485-08dc01d3f75c)
Gather with a group of ~5 others to destroy an exhumer. Small ISK investment.

### [Talos Ganks](https://www.eveworkbench.com/fitting/talos/6b0f4609-4829-48a2-6476-08dc01d3f75c)
When you have a point to make. Large ISK investment.

### [Harbor Pilot Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harbot_pilot)
Reserved for the gravest of offences towards The Golden Rule.   Use a combination of the above methods until the violator has demonstrated complete submission to the <abbr title="Workingmen's Benevolent Association">WBA</abbr>.  A pilot's complete submission must be demonstrated by exiting their ship when <abbr title="Workingmen's Benevolent Association">WBA</abbr> Harbor Pilots are present in local. If the pilot has exited their ship by the time a Harbor Pilot of the <abbr title="Workingmen's Benevolent Association">WBA</abbr> has appeared on grid, then their ship will be returned after it has been docked and thouroughly inspected.  Harbor Pilot Program membership is lifetime.
